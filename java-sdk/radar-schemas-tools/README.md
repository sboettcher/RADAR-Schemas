# RADAR Schemas tools

A number of tools are provided with RADAR-Schemas. They are most easily accessed by using the docker
image as described in the main readme. Below is more information about the schema validation that
the tools can perform.

The RADAR Schemas Validator checks if the `Schema Catalog` is in a valid state.

It first checks the folder structure, it has to be compliant with:
- commons
  * active
  * catalogue
  * kafka
  * monitor
  * passive
  * stream
- rest
- specification
  * active
  * monitor
  * passive
  * stream
  
For each Avro schema under `commons` folder checks if:
- in case of `ENUM`
  * the `namespace` differs from null and it is a lowercase string dot separated without numeric
  * the `name` matches the .avsc file name and it is an UpperCamelCase string
  * there is documentation
  * `symbols` match `UPPER_CASE` format
- in case of `RECORD`
  * the `namespace` differs from null and it is a lowercase string dot separated without numeric
  * the `name` matches the .avsc file name and it is an UpperCamelCase string
  * fields is not empty
  * the `field name` is a lowerCamelCase string and does not contain string such as `value`, `Value`.
  * schemas under `active` folder have `time` and `timeCompleted` fields, and do not contain a field named `timeReceived`
  * schemas under `monitor` folder have `time` field, and do not contain a field named either `timeCompleted` or `timeReceived`
  * schemas under `passive` folder have `time` and `timeReceived` fields, and do not have a field named `timeCompleted`
  * the record and any provided fields are documented
  * `ENUM` fields have `UNKNOWN` as `default` value, if any
  * `nullable`/`optional` fields have `null` as default value 
  
Upon rule violation, the end user is notified with a message explaining how to fix it.

## How to use

The validation is implemented as a `JUnit` test. To run the validation, simply type `./gradlew test`

## Suppress checks

Record name and field name validations can be suppressed modifying the [skip](src/test/resources/schema.yml) configuration file.

`files` lists file paths that can be ignored. It can contain values like
- entire path like `commons/active/questionnaire/questionnaire.avsc`
- folder and subfolder `commons/active/**/*`: all file under `active` and all its subfolder will be skipped
- folder and subfolder `commons/active/**/*.avsc`: all file with format `avsc` under `active` and all its subfolder will be skipped
- file name `.DS_Store`: all file named `.DS_Store` will be skipped
- file extension `*.md`: all file with extension `*.md` will be skipped

```yaml
files:
  - path/to/avoid/README.md
  - path/to/**/*
  - path/to/**/README.md
  - .DS_Store
  - *.md
``` 

`validation` allows the user to specify checks that should be skipped at schema level:
- a key like `org.radarcns.passive.biovotion.*` set a skip configuration valid for all schemas under `org.radarcns.passive.biovotion` package
- a key like `org.radarcns.passive.biovotion.BiovotionVSMSpO2` specify a configuration valid only for the given record
- `name_record_check: DISABLE` suppresses the record name check
- `fields` lists field names for which the field name check is suppressed
All tests are enable by default.

```yaml
validation:
  org.radarcns.passive.biovotion.BiovotionVSMSpO2:
    - fields:
        - fieldnameOne
        - fieldnameTwo
```
